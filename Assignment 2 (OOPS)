# Que 1: Explain the importance of functions.
Functions are blocks of reusable and organised code that usually perform a single, related action. 
They are a crucial part of programming because they save you a lot of time and make the code cleaner.
It eliminates redudancy and make larger code more efficient and easier to maintain.

# Que 2: Write a basic function to greet a student.
def _my_func_greet():
  print("Hello , Welcome to PW Skills Assignment 2" + "\n"+"Nice to meet you")

_my_func_greet()

# Que 3: What is the difference between return and print statement.
Return : 
(1) It is used to exit a function and return a value.
(2) It returns a value that can be assigned to a variable or used in any expression.
(3) It can be used multiple times in a function but only one value can be returned at a time.
(4) Exiting the function with return ends the function and control returns to calling code.

Print:
(1) It is used to display output to the console.
(2) It displays output to the console but does not return the value.
(3) It can be used multiple times in a function but does not affect the function’s return value.
(4) The print does not affect program flow and execution continues normally.

# Que 4: What are *args and **kwargs?
*args is known as variable length argument which means that it allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments i.e. arguments that are non-keyword arguments.
If we are not sure about the numbers of paramets t pass through a function then we can use *args.

**kwargs allows us to pass a variable number of keyworded arguments to the function.
*args has limitation to not accept data as dictionary , in that case **kwargs can be used to pass keywords and associated data values of keywords through a function.

# Que 5: What is iterator ?
An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.
It has methods __iter__() and __next__().
__iter__(): Called to initialize the iterator. It must return an iterator object.
__next__(): Called to iterate over the iterator. It must return the next value in the data stream.

# Que 26: What is encapsulation in oops?

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).
It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.
To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method.
Those types of variables are known as private variables.

# Que 27: Explain the use of access modifiers in python classes.

Access modifiers are defined as an important part of the visibility and accessibility of data members in the field of object-oriented programming.
Access modifiers help to define how classes, methods, and variables can be accessed and modified by using access modifiers.
Python used the ‘_’ symbol to define the accessibility and control of data members of the class.
Access modifiers play a crucial role in maintaining data security and preventing unauthorized modifications.

Types:
Public Access Modifier: The members defined in the public class can be accessed from anywhere. 
Protected Access Modifier: The members defined in the protected class can only be accessed from within the class in which they are declared and by its subclasses. 
Private Access Modifier: The members defined in the private class can only be accessed by class members.

# Que 28: What is inheritance in oops?

Inheritance is one of the core features of object-oriented programming. 
It’s a programming procedure that allows you to reuse code by referencing the behaviors and data of an object. 
In other words, a class that inherits from another class shares all the attributes and methods of the referenced class.

Types:

(1) Single Inheritance:
one class inherits from only one parent class. 
This is also called simple inheritance because it’s the simplest type of inheritance you can use.

(2) Hierarchical Inheritance
The inheritance in which a single base class inherits multiple derived classes is known as the Hierarchical Inheritance. 
This inheritance has a tree-like structure since every class acts as a base class for one or more child classes. 
The visibility mode for each derived class is specified separately during the inheritance and it accesses the data members accordingly.
An inherited class is called a subclass or child class of the class it inherits from. 
And the class being inherited is called either a parent class, superclass, or base class.

(3) Multilevel Inheritance
The inheritance in which a class can be derived from another derived class is known as Multilevel Inheritance.
Suppose there are three classes A, B, and C. A is the base class that derives from class B. 
So, B is the derived class of A. Now, C is the class that is derived from class B.
This makes class B, the base class for class C but is the derived class of class A. 
This scenario is known as the Multilevel Inheritance. 
The data members of each respective base class are accessed by their respective derived classes according to the specified visibility modes.

(4) Multiple Inheritance
The inheritance in which a class can inherit or derive the characteristics of multiple classes, or a derived class can have over one base class, is known as Multiple Inheritance. 
It specifies access specifiers separately for all the base classes at the time of inheritance. 
The derived class can derive the joint features of all these classes and the data members of all the base classes are accessed by the derived or child class according to the access specifiers. 

# Que 29: Define polymorphism in oops?

Polymorphism is the ability of any data to be processed in more than one form.
The word itself indicates the meaning as poly means many and morphism means types. 
Polymorphism is one of the most important concepts of object-oriented programming languages. 
The most common use of polymorphism in object-oriented programming occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

# Que 30: Explain method overriding in python?

Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. 
When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
(child class is always poerful than parent class)

# Que 36: What is abstraction in python? How is it implemented?
Data abstraction is one of the most essential concepts of Python OOPs which is used to hide irrelevant details from the user and show the details that are relevant to the users.It enables programmers to hide complex implementation details while just showing users the most crucial data and functions. This abstraction makes it easier to design modular and well-organized code, makes it simpler to understand and maintain, promotes code reuse, and improves developer collaboration.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod 
  
# Create Abstract base class 
class Car(ABC): 
  def __init__(self, brand, model, year): 
    self.brand = brand 
    self.model = model 
    self.year = year 
      
  # Create abstract method       
  @abstractmethod
  def printDetails(self): 
    pass
    
  # Create concrete method

# Que 37: Explain the importance of abstraction in object oriented programming.

(1) Abstraction: Abstract classes and methods provide a way to define a blueprint or template for a class without providing a complete implementation. This allows you to create a high-level abstract representation of an object or concept in your code.

(2) Enforce Structure: Abstract classes enforce a certain structure or contract that concrete subclasses must adhere to. This can help ensure that subclasses implement specific methods and attributes, making the code more reliable and maintainable.

(3) Polymorphism: Abstract classes and methods enable polymorphism, which is a core principle of object-oriented programming. Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes as long as they implement the same abstract methods. This promotes code reuse and flexibility.

(4) Forcing Implementation: Abstract methods are declared in the abstract class without any implementation. Subclasses are required to provide concrete implementations for these methods. This ensures that specific behavior is implemented in each subclass.

(5) Code Organization: Abstract classes can help organize your code by grouping related classes and methods together under a common abstraction. This can improve code readability and maintainability by providing a clear structure.

(6) Extensibility: Abstract classes can be extended by creating new subclasses that inherit the abstract methods. This allows you to add new functionality or features to your application by creating new subclasses without modifying existing code.

(7) Testing: Abstract classes can be useful for testing and mocking in unit testing scenarios. You can create mock subclasses to test the behavior of classes that depend on the abstract class without relying on actual implementations.

# Que 38: How abstract method are different from regular method?

Abstract Methods:
- An abstract method is a method declared in an abstract class that does not have an implementation in the abstract class.
- Subclasses deriving from an abstract class must provide concrete implementations for all the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.
- Abstract methods are defined using the abstract keyword and end with a semicolon instead of a method body.
- Abstract methods serve as placeholders that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

Regular Method:
Regular (instance) methods need a class instance and can access the instance through self . 
They can read and modify an objects state freely. Class methods, marked with the @classmethod decorator, don't need a class instance. They can't access the instance (self) but they have access to the class itself

# Que 39: How can you achieve abstraction using interfaces in python?

Abstraction in Python is achieved using abstract classes or interfaces provided by the "abc" module. Abstract classes define a common interface for their subclasses, while interfaces define a set of methods that must be implemented by classes that implement the interface. The use of abstract classes and interfaces allows you to create a high-level contract that all classes must adhere to.

# Que 40: Can you provide an example of how abstraction can be utlilized to creat common interface in python ?
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
# Define an abstract base class 'Shape'

    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

# Define a class 'Circle' that inherits from 'Shape'
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):

# Define a class 'Rectangle' that inherits from 'Shape'
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, length):
        self.width = width
        self.length = length

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.length
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.length)

# Create instances of 'Circle' and 'Rectangle'
circle = Circle(4)
rectangle = Rectangle(4,6)

print("The area of circle:",circle.area(),"\nThe perimeter of circle:",circle.perimeter()) 
print("The area of rectangle:",rectangle.area(),"\nThe perimeter of rectangle:",rectangle.perimeter())  

# Que 41: How does python achieve polymorphism through method overriding ?

Polymorphism is most commonly associated with inheritance. In Python, child classes, like other programming languages, inherit methods and attributes from the parent class. Method Overriding is the process of redefining certain methods and attributes to fit the child class. This is especially handy when the method inherited from the parent class does not exactly fit the child class. In such circumstances, the method is re-implemented in the child class. Method Overriding refers to the technique of re-implementing a method in a child class.


class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model, price):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.price = price

    def show(self):
        print('Details:', self.brand, self.model, 'Price:', self.price)

    def max_speed(self):
        print('Vehicle max speed is 160')

    def gear_system(self):
        print('Vehicle has 6 shifter gearbox')

# inherit from vehicle class

    def max_speed(self):
        print('Car max speed is 260')

    def gear_system(self):
        print('Car has Automatic Transmission')

# Car Object
car = Car('Audi', 'R8', 9000000)
car.show()

car.gear_system()

# Vehicle Object
vehicle = Vehicle('Nissan', 'Magnite', 550000)
vehicle.show()

# call method from a Vehicle class
vehicle.max_speed()
vehicle.gear_system()

In Python interpreter detects that the car object’s max_speed() and gear_system() methods are overridden due to polymorphism. As a result, it employs the one defined in the child class (Car).
The show() function, on the other hand, has not been modified, i.e. it is not overridden in the Car class, hence it is utilized from the Vehicle class.
