# Que 1: Explain the importance of functions.
Functions are blocks of reusable and organised code that usually perform a single, related action. 
They are a crucial part of programming because they save you a lot of time and make the code cleaner.
It eliminates redudancy and make larger code more efficient and easier to maintain.

# Que 2: Write a basic function to greet a student.
def _my_func_greet():
  print("Hello , Welcome to PW Skills Assignment 2" + "\n"+"Nice to meet you")

_my_func_greet()

# Que 3: What is the difference between return and print statement.
Return : 
(1) It is used to exit a function and return a value.
(2) It returns a value that can be assigned to a variable or used in any expression.
(3) It can be used multiple times in a function but only one value can be returned at a time.
(4) Exiting the function with return ends the function and control returns to calling code.

Print:
(1) It is used to display output to the console.
(2) It displays output to the console but does not return the value.
(3) It can be used multiple times in a function but does not affect the functionâ€™s return value.
(4) The print does not affect program flow and execution continues normally.
